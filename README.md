## Running Site Locally

This site is built with [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), a Ruby framework for building static sites.
You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), [rubygems](http://rubygems.org/) and
[bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed before you can run the site locally.

If the above dependencies are installed, in your command line of preference, navigate to the project repo and run:

```
bundle install
middleman
```

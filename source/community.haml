If you're just reporting a bug <a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues"add an issue</a> and note the version of Sass where you experienced the issue in your comment. If you have a some code to contribute, fork the stable branch and send us a pull request. We'll review your patch and either accept or decline with comments.

title: "Breaking Change: Random With Units"
introduction: >
  Sass `random($limit)` will no longer ignore `$limit` units in a future
  version. Passing a `$limit` with units will be deprecated to ensure the
  compilation results don't change once the new behavior lands.
---

The function [`random($limit)`] has historically ignored units in `$limit` which
returned a unitless value. For example `random(100px)` would drop "px" and
return a value like `42`.

[`random($limit)`]: ../modules/math#random

## Transition Period

<% impl_status dart: '1.54.5', libsass: false, ruby: false %>

First, we'll emit deprecation warnings for the previous uses of `random()` where
the `$limit` argument has units. We'll suggest a way to preserve the existing
behavior and a way that emulates the future implementation.

In Dart 2.0.0 passing a `$limit` number with units will be an error, and then in
a future minor release (i.e. >=2.1.0) we'll update `random($limit)` so the
returned value has the same units as the `$limit` argument.

title: "Breaking Change: Media Queries Level 4"
introduction: >
  Sass is adding support for the CSS Media Queries Level 4 specification, but
  this conflicts with some Sass-specific syntax. That syntax is deprecated to
  ensure that Sass remains fully CSS-compatible.
---

Because Sass supports almost any Sass expression in parenthesized media
conditions, there are a few constructs that could be broken by adding full
support for Media Queries Level 4. Specifically:

* `@media (not (foo))` was historically interpreted by Sass as meaning
  `@media (#{not (foo)})`, and so compiled to `@media (false)`.

* `@media ((foo) and (bar))` and `@media ((foo) or (bar))` were similarly
  interpreted as SassScript's logical operators, compiling to `@media (bar)` and
  `@media (foo)` respectively.

Fortunately, these are unlikely to come up in practice.

## Transition Period

<% impl_status dart: '1.54.0', libsass: false, ruby: false %>

First, we'll emit deprecation warnings for the previous ambiguous cases. These
will have suggestions for how to preserve the existing behavior or how to use
the new CSS syntax.

Once the deprecation warnings have been out for at least three months, we'll
release a version that exclusively interprets these ambiguous cases according to
the CSS spec.

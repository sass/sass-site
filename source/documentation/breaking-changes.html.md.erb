title: Breaking Changes
introduction: >
  New versions of Sass are as backwards-compatible as possible, but sometimes
  a breaking change is necessary. Sass needs to keep up with the evolving CSS
  specification, and old language design mistakes occasionally need to be fixed.

Before each breaking change is released, Sass implementations will produce
deprecation warnings for stylesheets whose behavior will change. Whenever
possible, these warnings will include suggestions for how to update the
deprecated styles to make them forward-compatible.

Different implementations have different policies for breaking changes and
deprecations. [Dart Sass][] will emit deprecation warnings for at least three
months before releasing a breaking change, and will release the breaking change
with a new major version number **unless that change is necessary for CSS
compatibility**. CSS compatibility changes are often both non-disruptive and
time-sensitive, so they may be released with new minor version numbers instead.

Sass is a stylesheet language that's compiled to CSS. It allows you to use
[variables][], [nested rules][], [mixins][], [functions][], and more, all with a
fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized
and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

[nested rules]: /documentation/style-rules#nesting
[mixins]: /documentation/at-rules/mixin
[functions]: /documentation/functions

* If you're looking for an introduction to Sass, check out [the
  tutorial](/guide).

* If you want to look up a built-in Sass function, look no further than [the
  function reference](/documentation/functions).

* If you're calling Sass from JavaScript, you may want the [JS API
  documentation][].

* Or the [Dart API documentation][] if you're calling it from Dart.

* Otherwise, **look to the right** for the table of contents for the language
  reference!

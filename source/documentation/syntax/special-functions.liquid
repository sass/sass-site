title: Special Functions
table_of_contents: true
introduction: >
  CSS defines many functions, and most of them work just fine with Sass’s normal
  function syntax. They’re parsed as function calls, resolved to [plain CSS
  functions](/documentation/at-rules/function#plain-css-functions), and compiled
  as-is to CSS. There are a few exceptions, though, which have special syntax
  that can’t just be parsed as a [SassScript
  expression](/documentation/syntax/structure#expressions). All special function
  calls return [unquoted strings](/documentation/values/strings#unquoted).

  ## `url()`

  The [`url()` function][] is commonly used in CSS, but its syntax is different
  than other functions: it can take either a quoted *or* unquoted URL. Because
  an unquoted URL isn't a valid SassScript expression, Sass needs special logic
  to parse it.

  [`url()` function]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url

  If the `url()`'s argument is a valid unquoted URL, Sass parses it as-is,
  although [interpolation][] may also be used to inject SassScript values. If
  it's not a valid unquoted URL—for example, if it contains [variables][] or
  [function calls][]—it's parsed as a normal [plain CSS function call][].

  ## `element()`, `progid:...()`, and `expression()`

  {% compatibility 'dart: "<1.40.0"', 'libsass: false', 'ruby: false', 'feature: "calc()"' %}
    LibSass, Ruby Sass, and versions of Dart Sass prior to 1.40.0 parse `calc()`
    as special syntactic function like `element()`.

    Dart Sass versions 1.40.0 and later parse `calc()` as a [calculation].

    [calculation]: /documentation/values/calculations
  {% endcompatibility %}

  {% compatibility 'dart: ">=1.31.0 <1.40.0"', 'libsass: false', 'ruby: false', 'feature: "clamp()"' %}
    LibSass, Ruby Sass, and versions of Dart Sass prior to 1.31.0 parse
    `clamp()` as a [plain CSS function] rather than supporting special syntax
    within it.

    [plain CSS function]: /documentation/at-rules/function#plain-css-functions

    Dart Sass versions between 1.31.0 and 1.40.0 parse `clamp()` as special
    syntactic function like `element()`.

    Dart Sass versions 1.40.0 and later parse `clamp()` as a [calculation].

    [calculation]: /documentation/values/calculations
  {% endcompatibility %}

  The [`element()`] function is defined in the CSS spec, and because its IDs
  could be parsed as colors, they need special parsing.

  [`element()`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/element

  [`expression()`][] and functions beginning with [`progid:`][] are legacy
  Internet Explorer features that use non-standard syntax. Although they're no
  longer supported by recent browsers, Sass continues to parse them for
  backwards compatibility.

  [`expression()`]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2008/10/16/ending-expressions/
  [`progid:`]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2009/02/19/the-css-corner-using-filters-in-ie8/

  Sass allows *any text* in these function calls, including nested parentheses.
  Nothing is interpreted as a SassScript expression, with the exception that
  [interpolation][] can be used to inject dynamic values.

title: JavaScript API
table_of_contents: true
---

Both major Sass implementations support the same JavaScript API. [Dart Sass][]
is distributed as the pure-Javascript [`sass` package][], and [LibSass][] is
distributed as a native extension in the [`node-sass` package][].

[Dart Sass]: /dart-sass
[`sass` package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass
[LibSass]: /libsass
[`node-sass` package]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass

## Usage

The Sass module provides two functions with similar APIs.

### `renderSync()`

This function synchronously compiles a Sass file to CSS. If it succeeds, it
returns the [result][], and if it fails it throws an [error][]. It takes an
[options object][], which must have either the [`file` option][] or the
[`data` option][] set.

[result]: #result-object
[error]: #error-object
[options object]: #options
[`file` option]: #file
[`data` option]: #data

```js
var sass = require('sass'); // or require('node-sass');

var result = sass.renderSync({file: "style.scss"});
// ...
```

### `render()`

<% impl_status dart: true, node: '3.0.0' %>

This function asynchronously compiles a Sass file to CSS, and calls a standard
Node callback with the [result][] or an [error][] when the rendering is
complete. It takes an [options object][], which must have either the
[`file` option][] or the [`data` option][] set.

<% heads_up do %>
When using Dart Sass, **[`renderSync()`][] is almost twice as fast as
`render()`** by default, due to the overhead of making the entire evaluation
process asynchronous. To avoid this performance hit, you can pass the
[`fiber` option][] to `render()`.

[`renderSync()`]: #rendersync
[`fiber` option]: #fiber
<% end %>

```js
var sass = require('sass'); // or require('node-sass');

sass.render({
  file: "style.scss"
}, function(err, result) {
  // ...
});
```

### `info`

<% impl_status dart: true, node: '2.0.0' %>

The `info` property contains a string that includes tab-separated information
about the Sass implementation. For Dart Sass, this is the version of Dart Sass
and the version of the [dart2js][] compiler used to compile it to JavaScript;
for LibSass, it's the version of LibSass and the version of [Node Sass][] that
wraps it.

[dart2js]: https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/dart2js
[Node Sass]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass

```js
console.log(sass.info);
// dart-sass	<%= impl_version(:dart) %>	(Sass Compiler)	[Dart]
// dart2js	2.0.0	(Dart Compiler)	[Dart]
```

### Result Object

When [`renderSync()`][] or [`render()`][] succeed, they provide a result object
that contains information about the compilation. This object has the following
properties:

[`renderSync()`]: #rendersync
[`render()`]: #render

#### `result.css`

The compiled CSS, as a [Buffer][]. This can be converted to a string by calling
[`Buffer.toString()`][].

[Buffer]: https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html
[`Buffer.toString()`]: https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({file: "style.scss"});

console.log(result.css.toString());
```

#### `result.map`

The source map that maps the compiled CSS to the source files from which it was
generated, as a [Buffer][]. This can be converted to a string by calling
[`Buffer.toString()`][].

This is `null` or `undefined` unless either

* the [`sourceMap` option][] is a string; or
* the `sourceMap` option is `true` *and* the [`outFile` option][] is set.

The source map uses absolute [`file:` URLs][] to link to the Sass source files,
except if the source file comes from the [`data` option][] in which case it
lists its URL as `stdin`.

[`sourceMap` option]: #sourcemap
[`outFile` option]: #outfile
[`file:` URLs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  sourceMap: true,
  outFile: "style.css"
})

console.log(result.map.toString());
```

#### `result.stats.includedFiles`

An array of the absolute paths of all Sass files loaded during compilation. If a
stylesheet was loaded from an [importer][] that returned the stylesheet's
contents, the raw strings of that stylesheet's `@import` is included in this
array.

[importer]: #importer

#### `result.stats.entry`

The absolute path of the input file passed as the [`file` option], or `"data"`
if the [`data` option] was passed instead.

#### `result.stats.start`

The number of milliseconds between 1 January 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC and the time
at which Sass compilation began.

#### `result.stats.end`

The number of milliseconds between 1 January 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC and the time
at which Sass compilation ended.

#### `result.stats.duration`

The number of milliseconds it took to compile the Sass file. This is always
equal to [`result.stats.start`][] minus [`result.stats.end`][].

[`result.stats.start`]: #result-stats-start
[`result.stats.end`]: #result-stats-end

### Error Object

When [`renderSync()`][] or [`render()`][] fail, they provide an
[`Error` object][] that contains information about the compilation. This object
has the following properties, in addition to the standard `Error` properties:

[`Error` object]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error

#### `error.formatted`

A string representation of the error. In [Node Sass][], this is more detailed
than [`error.toString()`][] or [`error.message`][]. In [Dart Sass][], it
provides the same information.

[`error.toString()`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/toString
[`error.message`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/message

#### `error.file`

The stylesheet where the error occurred. If the error occurred in a stylesheet
loaded from disk, this is the absolute path of that stylesheet. If the error
occurred in a stylesheet that was loaded from an [importer][] which returned the
stylesheet's contents, this is the raw string of that stylesheet's `@import`. If
it occurred in the contents of the [`data` option][], this is the string
`"stdin"`.

#### `error.line`

The line in [`error.file`][] on which the error occurred.

[`error.file`]: #error-file

#### `error.column`

The column of [`error.line`][] in [`error.file`][] on which the error occurred.

[`error.line`]: #error-line

#### `error.status`

The [exit status][] that should be used if this error causes the enclosing
program to exit.

[status]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status

## Options

### Input

These options control how Sass loads it input files.

#### `file`

<% impl_status dart: '1.11.0', node: false do %>
  Node Sass and older versions of Dart Sass support loading files with the
  extension `.css`, but contrary to the specification they're treated as SCSS
  files rather than being parsed as CSS. This behavior has been deprecated in
  Node Sass, and an update is in the works to load them as plain CSS instead.

  All versions of Node Sass and Dart Sass otherwise support the `file` option as
  described below.
<% end %>

This string option is the path to the file for Sass to load and compile. If the
file's extension is `.scss`, it will be parsed as [SCSS][]; if it's `.sass`, it
will be parsed as the [indented syntax][]; and if it's `.css`, it will be parsed
as [plain CSS][]. If it has no extension, it will be parsed as SCSS.

[SCSS]: syntax#scss
[indented syntax]: syntax#the-indented-syntax
[plain CSS]: at-rules/import#importing-css

If the `file` option and the [`data` option][] are both passed, the `file`
option is used as the path of the stylesheet for error reporting, but the `data`
option is used as the contents of the stylesheet. In this case, the `file`
option's extension is *not* used to determine the syntax of the stylesheet.

```js
sass.renderSync({file: "style.scss"});
```

#### `data`

This string option provides the contents of the stylesheet to compile. Unless
the [`file` option][] is passed as well, the stylesheet's URL is set to
`"stdin"`.

By default, this stylesheet is parsed as [SCSS][]. This can be controlled using
the [`indentedSyntax` option][].

[`indentedSyntax` option]: #indentedsyntax

```js
sass.renderSync({
  data: `
h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
}`
});
```

### `indentedSyntax`

This flag controls whether the [`data` option][] is parsed as the [indented
syntax][] or not. It defaults to `false`. It has no effect on stylesheets loaded
using the [`file` option][].

```js
sass.renderSync({
  data: `
h1
  font-size: 40px`,
  indentedSyntax: true
});
```

### `includePaths`

<% impl_status dart: '1.15.0', node: '3.9.0' %>
  Earlier versions of Dart Sass and Node Sass didn't support the `SASS_PATH`
  environment variable.
<% end %>

This array of strings option provides [load paths][] for Sass to look for
imports. Earlier load paths will take precedence over later ones.

[load paths]: at-rules/import#load-paths

```js
sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  includePaths: ["node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css"]
});
```

Load paths are also loaded from the `SASS_PATH` [environment variable][], if
it's set. This variable should be a list of paths separated by `;` (on Windows)
or `:` (on other operating systems). Load paths from the `includePaths` option
take precedence over load paths from `SASS_PATH`.

[environment variable]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable

```shellsession
$ SASS_PATH=node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css sass style.scss style.css
```

### Output

These options control how Sass produces output files.

#### `outputStyle`

This string option controls the output style of the resulting CSS. There are
four possible output styles:

* `"expanded"` (the default for Dart Sass) writes each selector and declaration
  on its own line.
* `"compressed"` removes as many extra characters as possible, and writes the
  entire stylesheet on a single line.
* `"nested"` (the default for Node Sass, not supported by Dart Sass) indents CSS
  rules to match the nesting of the Sass source.
* `compact` (not supported by Dart Sass) puts each CSS rule on its own single
  line.

```js
var source = `
h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
  code {
    font-face: Roboto Mono;
  }
}`;

var result = sass.renderSync({
  data: source,
  outputStyle: "expanded"
});
console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 {
//   font-size: 40px;
// }
// h1 code {
//   font-face: Roboto Mono;
// }

result = sass.renderSync({
  data: source,
  outputStyle: "compressed"
});
console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1{font-size:40px}h1 code{font-face:Roboto Mono}

result = sass.renderSync({
  data: source,
  outputStyle: "nested"
});
console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 {
//   font-size: 40px; }
//   h1 code {
//     font-face: Roboto Mono; }

result = sass.renderSync({
  data: source,
  outputStyle: "compact"
});
console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 { font-size: 40px; }
// h1 code { font-face: Roboto Mono; }
```

#### `precision`

<% impl_status dart: false, node: true do %>
  For performance reasons, Dart Sass doesn't allow its precision to be
  customized. It always supports 10 digits of numeric precision.
<% end %>

This integer option determines the [precision][] that will be used when
generating CSS that includes numbers. It defaults to 5 for Node Sass.

[precision]: values/numbers#precision

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({
  data: `
h1 {
  font-size: (100px / 3);
}`,
  precision: 20
});

console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 {
//  font-size: 33.333333333333336px; }
```

#### `indentType`

<% impl_status dart: true, node: '3.0.0' %>

This string option determines whether the generated CSS should use spaces (with
the value `"space"`) or tabs (with the value `"tab"`) for indentation. It
defaults to `"space"`.

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  indentType: "tab",
  indentWidth: 1
});

result.css.toString();
// "h1 {\n\tfont-size: 40px;\n}\n"
```

#### `indentWidth`

<% impl_status dart: true, node: '3.0.0' %>

This integer option controls how many spaces or tabs (depending on the
[`indentType` option][]) should be used per indentation level in the generated
CSS. It defaults to 2, and must be between 0 and 10 (inclusive).

[`indentType` option]: #indenttype

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  indentWidth: 4
});

console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 {
//    font-size: 40px;
// }
```

#### `linefeed`

<% impl_status dart: true, node: '3.0.0' %>

This string option controls what character sequence is used at the end of each
line in the generated CSS. It can have the following values:

* `lf` (the default) uses U+000A LINE FEED.
* `lfcr` uses U+000A LINE FEED followed by U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN.
* `cr` (the default) uses U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN.
* `crlf` uses U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN followed by U+000A LINE FEED.

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  linefeed: "crlf"
});

console.log(result.css.toString());
// "h1 {\r\n  font-size: 40px;\r\n}\r\n"
```

#### `sourceComments`

<% impl_status dart: false, node: true do %>
  This option isn't supported by Dart Sass, because [source maps][] are
  recommended as the best way of determining where a style rule is defined.
<% end %>

This flag causes Sass to emit comments for every style rule that indicate where
each style rule was defined in the source stylesheet. It defaults to `false`.

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  sourceComments: true
});

console.log(result.css.toString());
// /* line 1, style.scss */
// h1 {
//   font-size: 40px;
// }
```

### Source Maps

<%= partial 'documentation/snippets/source-maps' %>

The Sass JS API makes source maps available using the [`result.map` field][].

[`result.map` field]: #result-map

#### `sourceMap`

This flag controls whether source maps are generated.

If this option is a string, it's the path that the source map is expected to be
written to, which is used to link to the source map from the generated CSS and
to link *from* the source map to the Sass source files. Note that if the
`sourceMap` option is a string and the [`outFile` option][] isn't passed, Sass
assumes that the CSS will be written to the same directory as the [`file`
option][] if it's passed.

If this option is `true`, the path is assumed to be the `outFile` option with
`.map` added to the end. If it's `true` and the `outFile` option isn't passed,
it has no effect.

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  sourceMap: "out.map"
})
console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 {
//   font-size: 40px;
// }
// /*# sourceMappingURL=out.map */

result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  sourceMap: true,
  outFile: "out.css"
})
console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 {
//   font-size: 40px;
// }
// /*# sourceMappingURL=out.css.map */
```

#### `outFile`

This string option is the location that Sass expects the generated CSS to be
saved to. It's used to determine the URL used to link from the generated CSS to
the source map, and *from* the source map to the Sass source files.

<% heads_up do %>
  Despite the name, Sass does *not* write the CSS output to this file. The
  caller must do that themselves.
<% end %>

```js
result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  sourceMap: true,
  outFile: "out.css"
})
console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 {
//   font-size: 40px;
// }
// /*# sourceMappingURL=out.css.map */
```

#### `omitSourceMapUrl`

This flag causes Sass not to link from the generated CSS to the source map.

```js
var result = sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  sourceMap: "out.map",
  omitSourceMapUrl: true
})
console.log(result.css.toString());
// h1 {
//   font-size: 40px;
// }
```

#### `sourceMapContents`

This flag tells Sass to embed the entire contents of the Sass files that
contributed to the generated CSS in the source map. This may produce very large
source maps, but it guarantees that the source will be available on any computer
no matter how the CSS is served.

```js
sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  sourceMap: "out.map",
  sourceMapContents: true
})
```

#### `sourceMapEmbed`

This flag tells Sass to embed the contents of the source map file in the
generated CSS, rather than creating a separate file and linking to it from the
CSS.

```js
sass.renderSync({
  file: "style.scss",
  sourceMap: "out.map",
  embedSourceMap: true
})
```

#### `sourceMapRoot`

This string option is prepended to all the links from the source map to the Sass
source files.

### Plugins

These options use JavaScript callbacks to expand the functionality of Sass
compilation.

#### `functions`

This option defines additional built-in Sass functions that are available in all
stylesheets. It's an object whose keys are Sass function signatures and whose
values are JavaScript functions. Each function should take the same arguments as
its signature. If the signature takes [arbitrary arguments][], the JavaScript
function should take a single argument.

[arbitrary arguments]: at-rules/function#taking-arbitrary-arguments

Functions are passed JavaScript representations of [Sass value types][], and
must return the same. All functions can return synchronously, but functions
passed to the asynchronous [`render()` function][] can also take an additional
callback to which they can asynchronously pass the result of the function when
it's complete.

[Sass value types]: #value-types
[`render()` function]: #render

If a function synchronously throws an error, that error is reported to the
caller of the function and stylesheet compilation fails. There's currently no
way to asynchronously report an error.

<% heads_up do %>
  When writing custom functions, it's important to ensure that all the arguments
  are the types you expect. Otherwise, users' stylesheets could crash in
  hard-to-debug ways or, worse, compile to meaningless CSS.
<% end %>

```js
sass.render({
  data: `
h1 {
  font-size: pow(2, 5) * 1px;
}`,
  functions: {
    // This function uses the synchronous API, and can be passed to either
    // renderSync() or render().
    'pow($base, $exponent)': function(base, exponent) {
      if (!(base instanceof sass.types.Number)) {
        throw "$base: Expected a number.";
      } else if (base.getUnit()) {
        throw "$base: Expected a unitless number.";
      }

      if (!(exponent instanceof sass.types.Number)) {
        throw "$exponent: Expected a number.";
      } else if (exponent.getUnit()) {
        throw "$exponent: Expected a unitless number.";
      }

      return new sass.types.Number(
          Math.pow(base.getValue(), exponent.getValue()));
    },

    // This function uses the asynchronous API, and can only be passed to
    // render().
    'sqrt($number)': function(number, done) {
      if (!(number instanceof sass.types.Number)) {
        throw "$number: Expected a number.";
      } else if (number.getUnit()) {
        throw "$number: Expected a unitless number.";
      }

      done(new sass.types.Number(Math.sqrt(number.getValue())));
    }
  }
}, function(err, result) {
  console.log(result.css.toString());
  // h1 {
  //   font-size: 32px;
  // }
});
```

#### `importer`

<% impl_status dart: false, node: '3.0.0' do %>
  Versions of Node Sass before 3.0.0 don't support arrays of importers,
  nor do they support importers that return `Error` objects.

  Versions of Node Sass before 2.0.0 don't support the `importer` option at all.
<% end %>

This option defines one or more additional handlers for loading files when an
[`@import` rule][] is encountered. It can either be a single JavaScript
function, or an array of functions. These functions are always passed two
arguments:

[`@import` rule]: at-rules/import

1. The `@import` rule's URL as a string, exactly as it appears in the
   stylesheet.
2. A string identifying for the stylesheet that contained the `@import`. This
   identifier's format depends on how that stylesheet was loaded:
   * If the stylesheet was loaded from the filesystem, it's the absolute path of
     its file.
   * If the stylesheet was loaded from an importer that returned its contents,
     it's the URL of the `@import` rule that loaded it.
   * If the stylesheet came from the [`data` option][], it's the string
     `"stdin"`.

Importers must return one of the following types:

* An object with the key `contents` whose value is the contents of a stylesheet
  (in SCSS syntax). This causes Sass to load that stylesheet's contents.
* An object with the key `file` whose value is a path on disk. This causes Sass
  to load that file as though it had been imported directly.
* `null`, which indicates that it doesn't recognize the URL and another importer
  should be tried instead.
* An [`Error` object][], indicating that importing failed.

All importers can return synchronously, but importers passed to the asynchronous
[`render()` function][] can also take an additional callback to which they can
asynchronously pass the result of the import once it's complete.

```js
sass.render({
  file: "style.scss",
  importer: [
    // This importer uses the synchronous API, and can be passed to either
    // renderSync() or render().
    function(url, prev) {
      // This generates a stylesheet from scratch for `@import "big-headers"`.
      if (url != "big-headers") return null;

      return {
        contents: `
h1 {
  font-size: 40px;
}`
      };
    },

    // This importer uses the asynchronous API, and can only be passed to
    // render().
    function(url, prev, done) {
      // Convert `@import "foo/bar"` to "node_modules/foo/sass/bar".
      var components = url.split('/');
      var innerPath = components.slice(1).join('/');
      done({
        file: `node_modules/${components.first}/sass/${innerPath}`
      });
    }
  ]
}, function(err, result) {
  // ...
});
```

## Value Types

In order to support [custom functions][], Sass provides access to JavaScript
wrappers for its various [value types][]. These are all provided under the
`types` namespace in the main Sass module.

[custom functions]: #functions
[value types]: values

<% heads_up do %>
  All value types support methods that modify the value objects. Users are
  strongly discouraged from using these methods (except for the [`Map` type][]
  and [`List` type][] where they're necessary to create new values), because
  they don't match the general principle that Sass values are immutable. Users
  should construct new objects rather than modifying existing ones.

  
  [`Map` type]: #types-map
  [`List` type]: #types-list
<% end %>

### `types.Number`

This class represents a [Sass number][].

[Sass number]: values/numbers

#### `new types.Number(value[, unit = ''])`

Creates a new Sass number with the given numeric value and string unit.
[Complex units][] are parsed from the unit string: numerator units are separated
from denominators by a `/`. Multiple numerator and/or denominator units may be
separated by `*`.

[Complex units]: values/numbers#units

```js
new sass.types.Number(0.5); // == 0.5
new sass.types.Number(10, "px"); // == 10px
new sass.types.Number(10, "px*px"); // == 10px * 1px
new sass.types.Number(10, "px/s"); // == 10px / 1s
new sass.types.Number(10, "px*px/s*s"); // == 10px * 1px / 1s / 1s
```

#### `number.getValue()`

Returns the value of the number, ignoring units.

<% heads_up do %>
  This means that `96px` and `1in` will return different values, even though
  they represent the same length.
<% end %>

```js
var number = new sass.types.Number(10, "px");
console.log(number.getValue()); // 10
```

#### `number.getUnit()`

Returns the units of the number as a string. Complex units are returned in the
same format that [the constructor][new Number] accepts them.

[new Number]: #new-types-number-value-unit-39-39

```js
// number is `10px`.
console.log(number.getUnit()); // "px"

// number is `10px / 1s`.
console.log(number.getUnit()); // "px/s"
```

#### `number.setValue(value)`

Sets the value of the number, independent of its units.

#### `number.setUnit(unit)`

Sets the units of the number, independent of its numeric value. Complex units
are specified in the same format as for [the constructor][new Number].

### `types.String`

This class represents a [Sass string][].

[Sass string]: values/strings

<% heads_up do %>
  This API currently provides no way of distinguishing between a [quoted][] and
  [unquoted][] string.

  [quoted]: values/strings#quoted
  [unquoted]: values/strings#unquoted
<% end %>

#### `new types.String(value)`

Creates a new unquoted Sass string with the given value.

<% heads_up do %>
  This API currently provides no way of creating a [quoted][] string.

  [quoted]: values/strings#quoted
<% end %>

```js
new sass.types.String("Arial"); // == Arial
```

#### `string.getValue()`

Returns the contents of the string. If the string contains escapes, those
escapes are included literally if it's [unquoted][], while the values of the
escapes are included if it's [quoted][].

[unquoted]: values/strings#unquoted
[quoted]: values/strings#quoted

```js
// string is `Arial`.
string.getValue(); // "Arial"

// string is `"Helvetica Neue"`.
string.getValue(); // "Helvetica Neue"

// string is `\1F46D`.
string.getValue(); // "\\1F46D"

// string is `"\1F46D"`.
string.getValue(); // "👭"
```

#### `string.setValue(value)`

### `types.Boolean`

This class represents a [Sass boolean][].

[Sass boolean]: values/booleans

Custom functions should respect Sass's notion of [truthiness][] by treating
`false` and `null` as falsey and everything else as truthy.

[truthiness]: values/booleans#truthiness-and-falsinesss

<% heads_up do %>
  Calling `new sass.types.Boolean()` is forbidden.
<% end %>

#### `types.Boolean.TRUE`

The Sass value `true`.

#### `types.Boolean.FALSE`

The Sass value `false`.

#### `boolean.getValue()`

Returns `true` if the boolean is the Sass value `true`, and false if it's the
Sass value `false`.

```js
// boolean is `true`.
boolean.getValue(); // true
boolean === sass.types.Boolean.TRUE; // true

// boolean is `false`.
boolean.getValue(); // false
boolean === sass.types.Boolean.FALSE; // true
```

### `types.List`

This class represents a [Sass list][].

[Sass list]: values/lists

<% heads_up do %>
  This list type's methods use 0-based indexing, even though within Sass lists
  use 1-based indexing. These methods also don't support using negative numbers
  to index backwards from the end of the list.
<% end %>

#### `new types.List(length[, comma = true])`

Creates a new Sass list with the given number of elements. If `comma` is true,
the list is comma-separated; otherwise, it's space-separated.

<% heads_up do %>
  The initial values of the list elements are undefined. These elements must be
  set using the [`setValue()` method][] before accessing them or passing the
  list back to Sass.

  [`setValue()` method]: #list-setvalue-value
<% end %>

```js
var list = new sass.types.List(3);
list.setValue(0, new sass.types.Number(10, "px"));
list.setValue(1, new sass.types.Number(15, "px"));
list.setValue(2, new sass.types.Number(32, "px"));
list; // 10px, 15px, 32px
```

#### `list.getValue(index)`

Returns the element at the given (0-based) index in the list.

```js
// list is `10px, 15px, 32px`
list.getValue(0); // 10px
list.getValue(2); // 32px
```

#### `list.getSeparator()`

Returns `true` if the list is comma-separated, and `false` otherwise.

```js
// list is `10px, 15px, 32px`
list.getSeparator(); // true

// list is `1px solid`
list.getSeparator(); // false
```

#### `list.getLength()`

Returns the number of elements in the list.

```js
// list is `10px, 15px, 32px`
list.getLength(); // 3

// list is `1px solid`
list.getLength(); // 2
```

#### `list.setValue(index, value)`

Sets the element at the given (0-based) index in the list to the given value.

```js
// list is `10px, 15px, 32px`
list.setValue(1, new sass.types.Number(18, "px"));
list; // 10px, 18px, 32px
```

#### `list.setSeparator(comma)`

Sets whether the list is comma-separated.

### `types.Map`

This class represents a [Sass map][]. 

[Sass list]: values/maps

<% heads_up do %>
  This map type is represented as a list of key-value pairs rather than a
  mapping from keys to values. The only way to find the value associated with a
  given key is to iterate through the map checking for that key.

  Maps created through this API are still forbidden from having duplicate keys.
<% end %>

#### `new types.Map(length)`

Creates a new Sass map with the given number of key/value pairs.

<% heads_up do %>
  The initial keys and values of the map are undefined. They must be set using
  the [`setKey()` method][] and the [`setValue()` method][] before accessing
  them or passing the map back to Sass.

  [`setKey()` method]: #map-setkey-key
  [`setValue()` method]: #map-setvalue-value
<% end %>

```js
var map = new sass.types.Map(2);
map.setKey(0, new sass.types.String("width"));
map.setValue(0, new sass.types.Number(300, "px"));
map.setKey(1, new sass.types.String("height"));
map.setValue(1, new sass.types.Number(100, "px"));
map; // (width: 300px, height: 100px)
```

#### `map.getKey(index)`

Returns the key in the key/value pair at the given (0-based) index in the map.

```js
// map is `(width: 300px, height: 100px)`
map.getKey(0); // width
map.getKey(1); // height
```

#### `map.getValue(index)`

Returns the value in the key/value pair at the given (0-based) index in the map.

```js
// map is `(width: 300px, height: 100px)`
map.getValue(0); // 300px
map.getValue(1); // 100px
```

#### `map.getLength()`

Returns the number of key/value pairs in the map.

```js
// map is `("light": 200, "medium": 400, "bold": 600)`
map.getLength(); // 3

// map is `(width: 300px, height: 100px)`
map.getLength(); // 2
```

#### `map.setKey(index, key)`

Sets the key of the key/value pair at the given (0-based) index in the map to
the given value.

```js
// map is `("light": 200, "medium": 400, "bold": 600)`
map.setKey(0, new sass.types.String("lighter"));
map; // (lighter: 200, "medium": 400, "bold": 600)
```

#### `map.setValue(index, value)`

Sets the value of the key/value pair at the given (0-based) index in the map to
the given value.

```js
// map is `("light": 200, "medium": 400, "bold": 600)`
map.setKey(1, new sass.types.Number(300));
map; // ("light": 200, "medium": 300, "bold": 600)
```

### `types.Null`

This class represents the [Sass `null` value][].

[Sass `null` value]: values/null

<% heads_up do %>
  Calling `new sass.types.Null()` is forbidden.
<% end %>

#### `types.Null.NULL`

The Sass value `null`.

title: Placeholder Selectors
---

Sass has a special kind of selector known as a "placeholder". It looks and acts
a lot like a class selector, but it starts with a `%` and it's not included in
the CSS output. In fact, any complex selector (the ones between the commas) that
even *contains* a placeholder selector isn't included in the CSS, nor is any
style rule whose selectors all contain placeholders,

<%= partial "code-snippets/example-placeholder" %>

What's the use of a selector that isn't emitted? It can still be [extended][]!
Unlike class selectors, placeholders don't clutter up the CSS if they aren't
extended and they don't mandate that users of a library use specific class names
for their HTML.

<% example do %>
%toolbelt {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border-top: 1px rgba(#000, .12) solid;
  padding: 16px 0;
  width: 100%;

  &:hover { border: 2px rgba(#000, .5) solid; }
}

.action-buttons {
  @extend %toolbelt;
  color: #4285f4;
}

.reset-buttons {
  @extend %toolbelt;
  color: #cddc39;
}

%toolbelt
  box-sizing: border-box
  border-top: 1px rgba(#000, .12) solid
  padding: 16px 0
  width: 100%

  &:hover
    border: 2px rgba(#000, .5) solid

.action-buttons
  @extend %toolbelt
  color: #4285f4


.reset-buttons
  @extend %toolbelt
  color: #cddc39
<% end %>

Placeholder selectors are useful when writing a Sass library where each style
rule may or may not be used. As a rule of thumb, if you're writing a stylesheet
just for your own app, it's often better to just extend a class selector if one
is available.

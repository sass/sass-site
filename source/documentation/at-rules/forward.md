title: "@forward"
introduction: >
  The `@forward` rule loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its
  [mixins](/documentation/at-rules/mixin),
  [functions](/documentation/at-rules/function), and
  [variables](/documentation/variables) available when your stylesheet is
  loaded with the [`@use` rule](/documentation/at-rules/use). It makes it
  possible to organize Sass libraries across many files, while allowing their
  users to load a single entrypoint file.
---

The rule is written `@forward "<url>"`. It loads the module at the given URL
just like `@use`, but it makes the [public][] members of the loaded module
available to users of your module as though they were defined directly in your
module. Those members aren't available in your module, thoughâ€”if you want that,
you'll need to write a `@use` rule as well. Don't worry, it'll only load the
module once!

[public]: /documentation/at-rules/use#private-members

If you *do* write both a `@forward` and a `@use` for the same module in the same
file, it's always a good idea to write the `@forward` first. That way, if your
users want to [configure the forwarded module][], that configuration will be
applied to the `@forward` before your `@use` loads it without any configuration.

[configure the forwarded module]: /documentation/at-rules/use#configuration

{% funFact %}
  The `@forward` rule acts just like `@use` when it comes to a module's CSS.
  Styles from a forwarded module will be included in the compiled CSS output,
  and the module with the `@forward` can [extend][] it, even if it isn't also
  `@use`d.

  [extend]: /documentation/at-rules/extend
{% endfunFact %}

{% codeExample 'forward' %}
  // src/_list.scss
  @mixin list-reset {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }
  ---
  // bootstrap.scss
  @forward "src/list";
  ---
  // styles.scss
  @use "bootstrap";

  li {
    @include bootstrap.list-reset;
  }
  ===
  // src/_list.sass
  @mixin list-reset
    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    list-style: none
  ---
  // bootstrap.sass
  @forward "src/list"
  ---
  // styles.sass
  @use "bootstrap"

  li
    @include bootstrap.list-reset
  ===
  li {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }
{% endcodeExample %}

## Adding a Prefix

Because module members are usually used with [a namespace][], short and simple
names are usually the most readable option. But those names might not make sense
outside the module they're defined in, so `@forward` has the option of adding an
extra prefix to all the members it forwards.

This is written `@forward "<url>" as <prefix>-*`, and it adds the given prefix
to the beginning of every mixin, function, and variable name forwarded by the
module. For example, if the module defines a member named `reset` and it's
forwarded `as list-*`, downstream stylesheets will refer to it as `list-reset`.

[a namespace]: /documentation/at-rules/use#loading-members

{% codeExample 'prefix' %}
  // src/_list.scss
  @mixin reset {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }
  ---
  // bootstrap.scss
  @forward "src/list" as list-*;
  ---
  // styles.scss
  @use "bootstrap";

  li {
    @include bootstrap.list-reset;
  }
  ===
  // src/_list.sass
  @mixin reset
    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    list-style: none
  ---
  // bootstrap.sass
  @forward "src/list" as list-*
  ---
  // styles.sass
  @use "bootstrap"

  li
    @include bootstrap.list-reset
  ===
  li {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }
{% endcodeExample %}

## Controlling Visibility

Sometimes, you don't want to forward *every* member from a module. You may want
to keep some members private so that only your package can use them, or you may
want to require your users to load some members a different way. You can control
exactly which members get forwarded by writing `@forward "<url>" hide
<members...>` or `@forward "<url>" show <members...>`.

The `hide` form means that the listed members shouldn't be forwarded, but
everything else should. The `show` form means that *only* the named members
should be forwarded. In both forms, you list the names of mixins, functions, or
variables (including the `$`).

{% codeExample 'controlling-visibility', false %}
  // src/_list.scss
  $horizontal-list-gap: 2em;

  @mixin list-reset {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  @mixin list-horizontal {
    @include list-reset;

    li {
      display: inline-block;
      margin: {
        left: -2px;
        right: $horizontal-list-gap;
      }
    }
  }
  ---
  // bootstrap.scss
  @forward "src/list" hide list-reset, $horizontal-list-gap;
  ===
  // src/_list.sass
  $horizontal-list-gap: 2em

  @mixin list-reset
    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    list-style: none


  @mixin list-horizontal
    @include list-rest

    li
      display: inline-block
      margin:
        left: -2px
        right: $horizontal-list-gap
  ---
  // bootstrap.sass
  @forward "src/list" hide list-reset, $horizontal-list-gap
{% endcodeExample %}

## Configuring Modules

{% compatibility 'dart: "1.24.0"', 'libsass: false', 'ruby: false' %}{% endcompatibility %}

The `@forward` rule can also load a module with [configuration][]. This mostly
works the same as it does for `@use`, with one addition: a `@forward` rule's
configuration can use the `!default` flag in its configuration. This allows a
module to change the defaults of an upstream stylesheet while still allowing
downstream stylesheets to override them.

[configuration]: /documentation/at-rules/use#configuration

{% codeExample 'configuration' %}
  // _library.scss
  $black: #000 !default;
  $border-radius: 0.25rem !default;
  $box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default;

  code {
    border-radius: $border-radius;
    box-shadow: $box-shadow;
  }
  ---
  // _opinionated.scss
  @forward 'library' with (
    $black: #222 !default,
    $border-radius: 0.1rem !default
  );
  ---
  // style.scss
  @use 'opinionated' with ($black: #333);
  ===
  // _library.sass
  $black: #000 !default
  $border-radius: 0.25rem !default
  $box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default

  code
    border-radius: $border-radius
    box-shadow: $box-shadow
  ---
  // _opinionated.sass
  @forward 'library' with ($black: #222 !default, $border-radius: 0.1rem !default)
  ---
  // style.sass
  @use 'opinionated' with ($black: #333)
  ===
  code {
    border-radius: 0.1rem;
    box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.15);
  }
{% endcodeExample %}

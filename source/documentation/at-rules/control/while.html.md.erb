title: "@while"
---

The `@while` rule, written `@while <expression> { ... }`, evaluates its block if
its [expression][] returns `true`. Then, if its expression still returns `true`,
it evaluates its block again. This continues until the expression finally
returns `false`.

[expression]: ../syntax/structure#expressions

<% example do %>
/// Divides `$value` by `$ratio` until it's below `$base`.
@function scale-below($value, $base, $ratio: 1.618) {
  @while $value > $base {
    $value: $value / $ratio;
  }
  @return $value;
}

$normal-font-size: 16px;
sup {
  font-size: scale-below(20px, 16px);
}

<% heads_up do %>
Although `@while` is necessary for a few particularly complex stylesheets, you're
usually better of using either [`@each`][] or [`@for`][] if either of them will
work. They're clearer for the reader, and often faster to compile as well.

[`@each`]: each
[`@for`]: for

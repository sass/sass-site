title: "@for"
---

The `@for` rule, written
`@for <variable> from <expression> to <expression> { ... }` or
`@for <variable> from <expression> through <expression> { ... }`, counts up or
down from one number (the result of the first [expression][]) to another (the
result of the second) and evaluates a block for each number in between. Each
number along the way is assigned to the given variable name. If `to` is used,
the final number is excluded; if `through` is used, it's included.

title: "@each"
---

The `@each` rule makes it easy to emit styles or evaluate code for each element
of a [list][] or each pair in a [map][]. It's great for repetitive styles that
only have a few variations between them. It's usually written
`@each <variable> in <expression> { ... }`, where the [expression][] returns a
list. The block is evaluated for each element of the list in turn, which is
assigned to the given variable name.

[list]: ../../values/lists
[map]: ../../values/maps
[expression]: ../../syntax/structure#expressions

## With Maps

You can also use `@each` to iterate over every key/value pair in a map by
writing it `@each <variable>, <variable> in <expression> { ... }`. The key is
assigned to the first variable name, and the element is assigned to the second.

<%= partial 'code-snippets/example-each-map' %>

## Destructuring

If you have a list of lists, you can use `@each` to automatically assign
variables to each of the values from the inner lists by writing it
`@each <variable...> in <expression> { ... }`. This is known as *destructuring*,
since the variables match the structure of the inner lists. Each variable name
is assigned to the value at the corresponding position in the list, or
[`null`][] if the list doesn't have enough values.

[`null`]: ../../values/null

<% example do %>
  $icons:
    "eye" "\f112" 12px,
    "start" "\f12e" 16px,
    "stop" "\f12f" 10px;

  @each $name, $glyph, $size in $icons {
    .icon-#{$name}:before {
      display: inline-block;
      font-family: "Icon Font";
      content: $glyph;
      font-size: $size;
    }
  }
  ===
  $icons: "eye" "\f112" 12px, "start" "\f12e" 16px, "stop" "\f12f" 10px;




  @each $name, $glyph, $size in $icons
    .icon-#{$name}:before
      display: inline-block
      font-family: "Icon Font"
      content: $glyph
      font-size: $size
<% end %>

<% fun_fact do %>
  Because `@each` supports destructuring and [maps count as lists of lists][],
  `@each`'s map support works without needing special support for maps in
  particular.

  [maps count as lists of lists]: ../../values/maps

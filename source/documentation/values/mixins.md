title: Mixin Values

[Mixins] can also be values! You can't directly write a mixin as a value, but
you can pass a mixin's name to the [`meta.get-mixin()` function] to get it as a
value. Once you have a mixin value, you can pass it to the [`meta.apply()`
mixin] to call it. This is for libraries to be extensible in complex and
powerful ways.

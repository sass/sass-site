# About Sass

Sass was originally developed as a feature of the Haml markup language. Since
then, Sass has outgrown its original home as part of Haml and is now a thriving
project, much more popular than its original host project.

### Sass Language

It was originally conceived of by [Hampton Catlin](http://www.hamptoncatlin.com)
in 2006, however he only remained an active Core Team member through version
2009 and is no longer actively developing on Sass. [Natalie
Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com/) is the primary developer and designer of Sass and
has been involved in the project since the second commit. In 2008, [Chris
Eppstein](http://chriseppstein.github.io/) joined the Sass Core Team and is also
the creator of Compass. Since joining, he and Natalie have designed Sass
together have created most of the modern features of the language.

## Sass Website, Brand, and Design

The Sass website design was brought to you largely by [Jina
Anne](https://www.sushiandrobots.com), with major contributions from Bermon
Painter (who designed the logo], Michael Parenteau, and the Sass Language Core
Team.

**Everyone is welcome in the Sass community, except those who are unwelcoming**.
Please read and follow our [community guidelines](/community-guidelines).

Thinking of **contributing** to Sass itself? We rely on everyone to keep Sass as
stable as it is. Feel free to [submit a patch via pull request](#Contribute) to
the Sass project.

Want to create your own Sass implementation? Check out our [implementation
guidelines](/implementation).

<h2 id="Contribute">Contribute</h2>

Sass is an [open source project][github] and we encourage you to contribute. You
can contribute with [bug reports and feature requests][issues], and if you
contribute code, we'll love you forever. If you just want to help out but you're
not sure what to do, check out the "Help Wanted" label for [the Sass
language][lang help] or for [Dart Sass][dart help]. These issues are a mix of
feature requests, bugs, and tasks that aren't coding-intensive that the
developers think are a good place for someone new to the codebase to jump in.

[Dart Sass][] is the reference implementation of Sass, and the easiest
implementation to start hacking on. If you don't know Dart, don't worry! It's
very easy to pick up. Check out the [contributing info][] for more information
on helping out. Or, if you're interested in helping add new features to the Sass
language, look at [the language contribution process][].

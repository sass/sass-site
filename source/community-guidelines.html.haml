title: "Community Guidelines"

%p.introduction
  Sass is more than a technology; Sass is driven by the community of
  individuals that power its development and use every day. As a community, we
  want to embrace the very differences that have made our collaboration so
  powerful, and work together to provide the best environment for learning,
  growing, and sharing of ideas. It is imperative that we keep Sass a fun,
  welcoming, challenging, and fair place to play.

:markdown
  As such, the Sass Community Guidelines states our ideals as a community.
  It's meant to be a guide on how we work together and conduct ourselves, not
  a specific rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to the
  entire community, and share our values with the ‘verse.

  ## We strive to:

  ### Be considerate

  Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the
  work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and
  we should consider them when making decisions.

  ### Be open and inviting

  Our community has grown immensely because of the diversity that is found
  within the community. We welcome all individuals regardless of, but not
  limited to, their gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
  preferred relationship model, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  age, race, or religious affiliation. We take pride in the the richness of
  experiences that have come to help develop Sass, and want to continue
  growing our community. In short, __everyone is welcome, except those who
  are&nbsp;unwelcoming__.

  ### Be respectful

  Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve
  conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic
  fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A
  community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive
  one. __Harassment of other community members is never&nbsp;okay__.


  ### Take responsibility for our words and our actions

  We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If
  someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully,
  and work to right the&nbsp;wrong.

  ### Be collaborative

  What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts; it is the sum of many
  dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision
  is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part
  must make an effort to understand the whole.

  Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
  Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever
  possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free
  software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work
  transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.

  ### Value decisiveness, clarity and open communication

  Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to
  persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.

  We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements
  constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to either
  designated leaders at the event or within the community to arbitrate and
  provide clarity and direction.

  ### Be responsive and helpful

  All of us started as new and inexperienced. Even the most experienced of us
  may forget things. Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community.
  Questions are encouraged and those who are asked should endeavor to be
  responsive, courteous, and helpful. When off topic, please direct to the
  appropriate forum. Even when the question is common and repeatedly asked,
  even when the documentation explains it, remember that they have only asked
  it once and they may have read, but not understood. Ultimately, it is better
  to give no answer than an unfriendly one.

  ### Step down considerately

  When somebody leaves or disengages from the community, we ask that they do
  so in a way that minimizes disruption to the projects using their published
  work. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to
  ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

    We understand and acknowledge that the "Sass Community" is a loosely
    defined group of people who identify as Sass enthusiasts. We have no power
    to actively remove someone from the community. Ultimately, we can only use
    our voice to publicly declare that we do not agree with or endorse people
    or organizations who don't act in the spirit of these&nbsp;guidelines.

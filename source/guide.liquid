## Preprocessing

CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more
complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help.

Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting, mixins,
inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write robust,
maintainable CSS.

Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass
file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your website.

The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is
installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the `sass` command.
You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS
to. For example, running `sass input.scss output.css` from your terminal
would take a single Sass file, `input.scss`, and compile that file to
`output.css`.

You can also watch individual files or directories with the `--watch`
flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes,
and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch
(instead of manually build) your `input.scss` file, you'd just add the
watch flag to your command, like so:

```
sass --watch input.scss output.css
```

You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your
input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:

{% renderFile 'source/code-snippets/_homepage-sass-watch.md' %}

Sass would watch all files in the `app/sass` folder for changes, and
compile CSS to the `public/stylesheets` folder.

### 💡 Fun fact:

Sass has two syntaxes! The SCSS syntax (`.scss`) is used most commonly. It's
a superset of CSS, which means all valid CSS is also valid SCSS. The
indented syntax (`.sass`) is more unusual: it uses indentation rather than
curly braces to nest statements, and newlines instead of semicolons to
separate them. All our examples are available in both syntaxes.

  ## Variables

  Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse
  throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks,
  or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the `$` symbol
  to make something a variable. Here's an example:

{% endmarkdown %}

{% codeExample 'variables' %}
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
===
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif
$primary-color: #333

body
  font: 100% $font-stack
  color: $primary-color
{% endcodeExample %}

{% markdown %}
When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the
`$font-stack` and `$primary-color` and outputs normal CSS with our
variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when
working with brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the site.

## Nesting

When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.

Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same
visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will
result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is
generally considered bad practice.

With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a site's
navigation:

{% endmarkdown %}

{% codeExample 'nesting' %}
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
===
nav
  ul
    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    list-style: none

  li
    display: inline-block

  a
    display: block
    padding: 6px 12px
    text-decoration: none
{% endcodeExample %}

## Partials

You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files.
This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a
Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something
like `_partial.scss`. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only
a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass
partials are used with the `@use` rule.

## Modules

{% assign implStatusData = "1.23.0" | implStatus: false, false, false, false, "Only Dart Sass currently supports `@use`. Users of other implementations must use the [`@import` rule][] instead.

[`@import` rule]: /documentation/at-rules/import" %}
{% render 'impl_status', implStatusData: implStatusData %}

You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up
however you want with the `@use` rule. This rule loads another Sass file as a
_module_, which means you can refer to its variables, [mixins][], and
[functions][] in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. Using a
file will also include the CSS it generates in your compiled output!

[mixins]: #topic-6
[functions]: documentation/at-rules/function

{% endmarkdown %}

{% codeExample 'modules' %}
// _base.scss
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
---

// styles.scss
@use 'base';

.inverse {
  background-color: base.$primary-color;
  color: white;
}

===
// _base.sass
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif
$primary-color: #333

body
  font: 100% $font-stack
  color: $primary-color
---

// styles.sass
@use 'base'

.inverse
  background-color: base.$primary-color
  color: white
===

body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}

.inverse {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
}

## Mixins

Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. It helps keep your
Sass very DRY. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. Here's an example for `theme`.

{% endmarkdown %}

{% codeExample 'mixins' %}
@mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) {
  background: $theme;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, .25);
  color: #fff;
}

.info {
  @include theme;
}
.alert {
  @include theme($theme: DarkRed);
}
.success {
  @include theme($theme: DarkGreen);
}

===

@mixin theme($theme: DarkGray)
  background: $theme
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, .25)
  color: #fff

.info
  @include theme
.alert
  @include theme($theme: DarkRed)

.success
  @include theme($theme: DarkGreen)
{% endcodeExample %}

{% markdown %}
To create a mixin you use the `@mixin` directive and give it a name. We've named our mixin `theme`. We're also using the variable `$theme` inside the parentheses so we can pass in a `theme` of whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it as a CSS declaration starting with `@include` followed by the name of the mixin.

## Extend/Inheritance

Using `@extend` lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. In our example we're going to create a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it is extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.

{% endmarkdown %}

{% codeExample 'extend-inheritance' %}
// This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended.
%message-shared {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

// This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.
%equal-heights {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.message {
  @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  @extend %message-shared;
  border-color: yellow;
}
===

// This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended.
%message-shared
  border: 1px solid #ccc
  padding: 10px
  color: #333

// This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.
%equal-heights
  display: flex
  flex-wrap: wrap

.message
  @extend %message-shared

.success
  @extend %message-shared
  border-color: green

.error
  @extend %message-shared
  border-color: red

.warning
  @extend %message-shared
  border-color: yellow
{% endcodeExample %}

{% markdown %}
What the above code does is tells `.message`, `.success`, `.error`, and
`.warning` to behave just like `%message-shared`. That means anywhere that
`%message-shared` shows up, `.message`, `.success`, `.error`, & `.warning` will
too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where each of these classes will
get the same CSS properties as `%message-shared`. This helps you avoid having to
write multiple class names on HTML elements.

You can extend most simple CSS selectors in addition to placeholder classes in
Sass, but using placeholders is the easiest way to make sure you aren't
extending a class that's nested elsewhere in your styles, which can result in
unintended selectors in your CSS.

Note that the CSS in `%equal-heights` isn't generated, because `%equal-heights`
is never extended.

## Operators

Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math
operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `math.div()`, and `%`. In our example we're going
to do some simple math to calculate widths for an `article` and `aside`.

{% endmarkdown %}

{% codeExample 'operators' %}
@use "sass:math";

.container {
  display: flex;
}

article[role="main"] {
  width: math.div(600px, 960px) * 100%;
}

aside[role="complementary"] {
  width: math.div(300px, 960px) * 100%;
  margin-left: auto;
}

===
@use "sass:math"

.container
  display: flex

article[role="main"]
  width: math.div(600px, 960px) * 100%

aside[role="complementary"]
  width: math.div(300px, 960px) * 100%
  margin-left: auto

===

.container {
  display: flex;
}

article[role="main"] {
  width: 62.5%;
}

aside[role="complementary"] {
  width: 31.25%;
  margin-left: auto;
}
{% endcodeExample %}

{% markdown %}
We've created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations in Sass
let us do something like take pixel values and convert them to percentages
without much hassle.

title: Install Sass

%h2 There are a couple of ways to start using&nbsp;Sass:
%ol.list-columns
  %li.gui-application
    %h3 Applications
    %p= image_tag "illustrations/mouse.svg", class: "header-image", height: "160", alt: "Mouse"
    %p
      There are a good many applications that will get you up and running
      with Sass in a few minutes for Mac, Windows, and Linux. You can download
      most of the applications for free but a few of them are paid apps
      <small>(and totally worth it)</small>.

      When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the
      `sass` executable to compile `.sass` and `.scss` files to `.css` files.
      For example:

          sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css

      First install Sass using one of the options below, then run
      `sass --version` to be sure it installed correctly. If it did, this will
      include `#{impl_version(:dart)}`. You can also run `sass --help` for more
      information about the command-line interface.

      Once it's all set up, <strong>go and play</strong>. If you're brand new to
      Sass we've set up some resources to help you learn pretty darn quick.

      %dt Install Anywhere (Standalone)
      %dd
        You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the
        package for your operating system
        #{link_to "from GitHub", release_url(:dart)} and
        <a href="https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/">adding it to your
        <code>PATH</code></a>. That's allâ€”there are no external dependencies and
        nothing else you need to install.

      %dt Install Anywhere (npm)
      %dd
        %p
          If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> by running

        %pre
          :preserve
            npm install -g sass

        <strong>However, please note</strong> that this will install the pure
        JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the
        other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so it'll be
        easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more
        speed!

      %dt Install on Windows (Chocolatey)

          manager</a> for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running

        %pre
          :preserve
            choco install sass

      %dt Install on Mac OS X (Homebrew)
      %dd
        %p
          If you use <a href="https://brew.sh/">the Homebrew package
          manager</a> for Mac OS X, you can install Dart Sass by running

        %pre
          :preserve
            brew install sass/sass/sass

%h2 There are a couple of ways to start using&nbsp;Sass:
%ol.list-columns
  %li.gui-application
    %h3 Applications
    %p
      There are a a good many applications that will get you up and running
      with Sass in a few minutes for Mac, Windows, and Linux. You can download
      most of the applications for free but a few of them are paid apps
      <small>(and totally worth it)</small>.

  %li.command-line-unix
    %h3 Command Line
    %dl#install-ruby-linux
      %dt Linux
      %dd
        If you're using a distribution of Linux, you'll need to install Ruby
        first. You can use --something--, or --something--,
        or --something else--.

    %dl#install-ruby-windows
      %dt Windows
      %dd
        Before you start using Sass you will need to install Ruby. The fastest
        way to get Ruby on your Windows computer is to use
        <a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org">Ruby Installer</a>. It's a
        single-click installer that will get everything set up for you super
        fast.

      %dd
        Along with Ruby the installer will also install a Ruby command line
        application that will let you use the Ruby libraries.
        Open --application name--.

      %dl#install-ruby-mac
        %dt Mac
        %dd
          If you prefer the command line over an application then getting Sass
          set up is a fairly quick process. Sass has a Ruby dependency but if
          you're using a Mac, congratulations, Ruby comes pre-installed.

        %dd
          %p
            Here's the quickest way we've found to start using Sass by using
            the command line:

          %ol
            %li
              %p
                <strong>Open your command line application.</strong> On the
                Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located
                in your "Utilities" folder.

            %li
              %p
                <strong>Install Sass.</strong> Ruby uses Gems to manage its
                various packages of code like Sass. In your open terminal
                window type:
              %pre
                :preserve
                  gem install sass
              %p
                This will install Sass and any dependencies for you. It's pretty
                magical.

            %li
              %p
                <strong>Double-check.</strong> You should now have Sass
                installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your
                terminal application you can type:
              %pre
                :preserve
                  sass -v
              - if data.respond_to?(:version)
                %p It should return <code>Sass #{data.version.number} (#{data.version.name})</code>. Congratulations! You've successfully installed Sass.
              - else
                %p It should return <code>Sass ???</code>. Congratulations! You've successfully installed Sass.

            %li
              %p
                <strong>Go and play.</strong> If you're brand new to Sass
                we've set up some resources to help you learn pretty darn
                quick.

The `@use` rule is intended to replace the old [`@import` rule], but it's
intentionally designed to work differently. Here are some major differences
between the two:

* `@use` only makes variables, functions, and mixins available within the scope
  of the current file. It never adds them to the global scope. This makes it
  easy to figure out where each name your Sass file references comes from, and
  means you can use shorter names without any risk of collision.

* `@use` only ever loads each file once. This ensures you don't end up
  accidentally duplicating your dependencies' CSS many times over.

* `@use` must appear at the beginning your file, and cannot be nested in style
  rules. Nested imports can be migrated to [mixin calls or `meta.load-css()`].

* Each `@use` rule can only have one URL.

* `@use` requires quotes around its URL, even when using the [indented syntax].

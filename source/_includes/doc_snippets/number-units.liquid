## Units

Sass has powerful support for manipulating units based on how [real-world unit
calculations][] work. When two numbers are multiplied, their units are
multiplied as well. When one number is divided by another, the result takes its
numerator units from the first number and its denominator units from the second.
A number can have any number of units in the numerator and/or denominator.

  // calc(3.125px * 1deg / 1s / 1em) (read "pixel-degrees per second-em")

  In CSS, numbers with complex units can only be represented in `calc()` and
  other mathematical expressions, so Sass emits these numbers as `calc()`
  expressions. Normal CSS properties don't accept complex units, but they can be
  useful in [custom properties] or [functions].

  [custom properties]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Cascading_variables/Using_custom_properties
  [functions]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Custom_functions_and_mixins/Using_custom_functions

  {% compatibility 'dart: "1.96.0"', 'libsass: false', 'ruby: false', 'feature: "Complex Units in CSS"' %}
    CSS only specified support for complex units like square pixels in [Values
    and Units Level 4], and browsers only began implementing it in 2025. Earlier
    versions of Sass produced errors when trying to use a value with complex
    units in CSS, although they could still be used in Sass variables and
    functions.

    [Values and Units Level 4]: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/

    From Dart Sass 1.69.6 forward, [`meta.inspect()`] returns valid `calc()`
    expressions for numbers with complex units.

Sass will automatically convert between compatible units, although which unit it
will choose for the result depends on which implementation of Sass you're using.
If you try to combine incompatible units, like `1in + 1em`, Sass will throw an
error.

{% codeExample 'compatible-units', false %}
  // CSS defines one inch as 96 pixels.
  @debug 1in + 6px; // 102px or 1.0625in

  @debug 1in + 1s;
  //     ^^^^^^^^
  // Error: Incompatible units s and in.
  ===
  // CSS defines one inch as 96 pixels.
  @debug 1in + 6px  // 102px or 1.0625in

  @debug 1in + 1s
  //     ^^^^^^^^
  // Error: Incompatible units s and in.
{% endcodeExample %}

As in real-world unit calculations, if the numerator contains units that are
compatible with units in the denominator (like `math.div(96px, 1in)`), they'll
cancel out. This makes it easy to define a ratio that you can use for converting
between units. In the example below, we set the desired speed to one second per
50 pixels, and then multiply that by the number of pixels the transition covers
to get the time it should take.

{% codeExample 'transition' %}
  @use 'sass:math';

  $transition-speed: math.div(1s, 50px);

  @mixin move($left-start, $left-stop) {
    position: absolute;
    left: $left-start;
    transition: left ($left-stop - $left-start) * $transition-speed;

    &:hover {
      left: $left-stop;
    }
  }

  .slider {
    @include move(10px, 120px);
  }
  ===
  @use 'sass:math'

  $transition-speed: math.div(1s, 50px)

  @mixin move($left-start, $left-stop)
    position: absolute
    left: $left-start
    transition: left ($left-stop - $left-start) * $transition-speed

    &:hover
      left: $left-stop



  .slider
    @include move(10px, 120px)
{% endcodeExample %}

  If your arithmetic gives you the wrong unit, you probably need to check your
  math. You may be leaving off units for a quantity that should have them!
  Staying unit-clean allows Sass to give you helpful errors when something isn't
  right.

  You should especially avoid using interpolation like `#{$number}px`. This
  doesn't actually create a number! It creates an [unquoted string][] that
  *looks* like a number, but won't work with any [number operations][] or
  [functions][]. Try to make your math unit-clean so that `$number` already has
  the unit `px`, or write `$number * 1px`.

  Percentages in Sass work just like every other unit. They are *not*
  interchangeable with decimals, because in CSS decimals and percentages mean
  different things. For example, `50%` is a number with `%` as its unit, and
  Sass considers it different than the number `0.5`.

  You can convert between decimals and percentages using unit arithmetic.
  `math.div($percentage, 100%)` will return the corresponding decimal, and
  `$decimal * 100%` will return the corresponding percentage. You can also use
  the [`math.percentage()` function][] as a more explicit way of writing
  `$decimal * 100%`.

## Can I Silence the Warnings?

Sass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation
warnings you see and when.

### Terse and Verbose Mode

By default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of
deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This
helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking
change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.

If you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print *every* deprecation
warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be
done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the
[`--verbose` flag] on the command line, or the [`verbose` option] in the
JavaScript API.

[`--verbose` flag]: /documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose
[`verbose` option]: /documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose

  When running from the [JS API], Sass doesn't share any information across
  compilations, so by default it'll print five warnings for *each stylesheet*
  that's compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of
  your favorite framework's Sass plugin to write) a [custom `Logger`] that only
  prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple
  compilations.

### Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies

Sometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can't do
anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while
still printing them for your app using the [`--quiet-deps` flag] on the command
line, or the [`quietDeps` option] in the JavaScript API.

[`--quiet-deps` flag]: /documentation/cli/dart-sass/#quiet-deps
[`quietDeps` option]: /documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#quietDeps

For the purposes of this flag, a "dependency" is any stylesheet that's not just
a series of relative loads from the entrypoint stylesheet. This means anything
that comes from a load path, and most stylesheets loaded through custom
importers.

### Silencing Specific Deprecations

If you know that one particular deprecation isn't a problem for you, you can
silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the
[`--silence-deprecation` flag] on the command line, or the [`silenceDeprecations`
option] in the JavaScript API.

[`--silence-deprecation` flag]: /documentation/cli/dart-sass/#silence-deprecation
[`silenceDeprecations` option]: /documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#silenceDeprecations

  This option is only available in the [modern JS API].

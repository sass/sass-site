%p.introduction
  We want everyone to enjoy Sass, no matter what language they use. Sass was
  originally written in Ruby.

  is a C/C++ port of the Sass engine. The point is to be simple, faster, and
  easy to integrate. Find out more about the project over at

  ## Wrappers

  LibSass is just a library. To run the code locally (i.e. to compile your stylesheets), you need an implementer, or "wrapper". There are a number of other wrappers for LibSass. We encourage you to write your own wrapper - the whole point of Libsass is that we want to bring Sass to many other languages, not just Ruby!

  Below are the libSass wrappers that we're currently aware of. Sometimes there are multiple wrappers per language – in those cases, we put the most recently-updated wrapper first.

%ul.slides
  %li#sassc
    :markdown
      ### Sass C
      SassC (get it?) is an wrapper written in C.

      To run the compiler on your local machine, you need to build SassC. To build SassC, you must have either a local copy of the libsass source or it must be installed into your system. For development, please use the source version. You must then setup an environment variable pointing to the LibSass folder, for example:

    ~ partial "code-snippets/libsass-setup"

    %p
      The executable will be in the bin folder. To run it, simply try something like:

    ~ partial "code-snippets/libsass-execute"

  %li#go
    :markdown
      ### Go
      [Wellington](https://github.com/wellington/wellington) is an extension to libsass that adds spriting and is available on brew:

      `brew install wellington`

      There are also three other libsass wrappers in go: [gosass](https://github.com/moovweb/gosass), [go-sass](https://github.com/SamWhited/go-sass) and [go_sass](https://github.com/suapapa/go_sass) which have not been updated in a while.

  %li#java
    :markdown
      ### Java
      There is one Java wrapper – the [libSass Maven plugin](https://github.com/warmuuh/libsass-maven-plugin).

  %li#javascript
    :markdown
      ### JavaScript
      The only pure JavaScript implementation is [sass.js](https://github.com/medialize/sass.js). There's a [browser-based way to test it out](http://medialize.github.io/sass.js/), too.

  %li#lua
    :markdown
      ### Lua
      The lua wrapper is found at [lua-sass](https://github.com/craigbarnes/lua-sass).

  %li#net
    :markdown
      ### .NET
      [libsass-net](https://github.com/darrenkopp/libsass-net) is updated regularly, and is probably the best bet. There's also [NSass](https://github.com/TBAPI-0KA/NSass), although it hasn't been updated in a while.

  %li#node
    :markdown
      ### Node
      The [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) project has proven to be popular, and we've taken it into the main Sass GitHub repo. Check out its package page [here](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-sass), and [there's a dedicated twitter account](https://twitter.com/nodesass) for updates.

  %li#perl
    :markdown
      ### Perl
      The [CSS::Sass](https://github.com/sass/perl-libsass) project is updated regularly. There's the [Text-Sass-XS](https://github.com/ysasaki/Text-Sass-XS) project, too, although it hasn't been updated in a while.

  %li#php
    :markdown
      ### PHP
      The [SassPHP](https://github.com/sensational/sassphp) project is an updated fork of an [older PHP version](https://github.com/jamierumbelow/sassphp).

  %li#python
    :markdown
      ### Python
      There are two python projects that are updated regularly. The [libsass-python](https://github.com/dahlia/libsass-python) project (there are more details on [its own website](http://hongminhee.org/libsass-python/)) and the [python-scss](https://github.com/pistolero/python-scss) project.

      Two other python projects, [pylibsass](https://github.com/rsenk330/pylibsass) and [SassPython](https://github.com/marianoguerra/SassPython), haven't been updated in a while.


  %li#ruby
    :markdown
      ### Ruby
      libSass has also been ported back into ruby, for the [ruby-libsass](https://github.com/sass/ruby-libsass) project.

  %li#scala
    :markdown
      ### Scala
      The only scala project, [Sass-Scala](https://github.com/kkung/Sass-Scala), hasn't been updated in a couple of years.

%h2 There are a couple of ways to start using&nbsp;Sass:
%ol.list-columns
  %li.gui-application
    %h3 1. Applications
    %p There are a a good many applications that will get you up and running with Sass in a few minutes for Mac, Windows, and Linux. You can download most of the applications for free but a few of them are paid apps <small>(and totally worth it)</small>.

    / The applications are listed in alphabetical order. As new applications are released they should be added to the list.

    %h3 2. Command Line

    #install-ruby-linux
      %strong 1. Linux
      %p If you're using a distribution of Linux, you'll need to install Ruby first. You can use --something--, or --something--, or --something else--.

    #install-ruby-windows
      %strong 1. Windows
      %p Before you start using Sass you will need to install Ruby. The fastest way to get Ruby on your Windows computer is to use <a href="http://www.rubyinstaller.org">Ruby Installer</a>. It's a single-click installer that will get everything set up for you super fast.

      %p Along with Ruby the installer will also install a Ruby command line application that you will let you use the Ruby libraries. Open --application name--.

    #install-ruby-mac
      %strong 1. Mac
      %p If you prefer the command line over an application then getting Sass set up is a fairly quick process. Sass has a Ruby dependency but if you're using a Mac, congratulations, Ruby comes pre-installed.

    %p Here's the quickest way we've found to start using Sass by using the command line:

    %ol
      %li
        %p <strong>2. Open your command line application.</strong> On the Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located in your "Utilities" folder.
      %li
        %p <strong>3. Install Sass.</strong> Ruby uses Gems to manage it's various packages of code like Sass. In your open terminal window type:
        %pre
          :preserve
            gem install sass
        %p This will install Sass and any dependencies for you. It's pretty magical.
      %li
        %p <strong>4. Double-check.</strong> You should now have Sass installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your terminal application you can type:
        %pre
          :preserve
            sass -v
        - if data.respond_to?(:version)
          %p It should return <code>Sass #{data.version.number} (#{data.version.name})</code>. Congratulations! You've successfully installed Sass.
        - else
          %p It should return <code>Sass ???</code>. Congratulations! You've successfully installed Sass.
      %li
        %p <strong>5. Go and play.</strong> If you're brand new to Sass we've set up some resources to help you learn pretty darn quick.

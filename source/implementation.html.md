title: Implementation Guide
introduction: >
  Sass has a thriving community of implementations, with more being produced all
  the time. The core team loves to see new implementations thrive and mature,
  and they want to help out in any way they can.

## Resources

* [`sass-spec`](https://github.com/sass/sass-spec) is a suite of
  implementation-agnostic test cases for verifying that a Sass implementation
  behaves correctly. It's the best way to track your implementation's
  compatibility with the Sass reference implementation.

* [How `@extend` Works](https://gist.github.com/nex3/7609394) is a fairly
  comprehensive run-down of the algorithm used by Sass's trickiest feature.
  Natalie still says that the implementation of `@extend` is the hardest code
  she's ever had to write, but luckily you don't have to figure it out from
  scratch.

* **Reach out!** If you're working on a new implementation, we want to hear
  about it. Send an email to [Natalie](mailto:nex342@gmail.com) and
  [Chris](mailto:chris@eppsteins.net), tell us about the cool work you're
  doing, and ask about any corners of the language that don't quite make
  sense.

## Requirements

We whole-heartedly love new implementations of Sass, but we do have a few
restrictions that we ask those implementations to follow in order to call
themselves "Sass", "Sass implementations", or the like. Sass is a community as
much as it is a language, and it's important that all implementations are
willing to work for the good of the community.

First, we ask that every implementation adopt the [Sass community
guidelines](/community-guidelines) for their own implementation-specific
communities. Much of what makes the Sass community strong is a culture of
kindness and respect, and having clear and explicit guidelines helps produce
that culture.

Second, we ask that implementations not extend the language without agreement
from the other major implementations and from the language designers, Natalie
and Chris. The only reason a Sass community exists at all is because the
language enables styles and frameworks to be shared among designers, and it's
crucial for sharing that Sass code that works for one implementation works the
same for all of them. In addition, it's important that there be a unified
vision for the language design.

## Making Language Changes

Sass can still evolve as a language, of course. We're working on putting
together a more explicit process for proposing and iterating on new language
features, but for now all discussion of changes happens on [the Sass issue
tracker](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues). Language changes are
considered final when they're part of a stable release of the Ruby reference
implementation.

Language changes are discussed collaboratively, with particular weight given
to the maintainers of mature Sass implementations. Attempts will be made to
reach consensus with all stakeholders. However, this may be impossible in
some circumstances, and the ultimate say lies with the lead designer of
Sass, Natalie. Chris, the other core designer, also has veto power over any
language change.

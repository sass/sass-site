      __Everyone is welcome in the Sass community, except those who are
      unwelcoming__. Please read and follow our
      [community&nbsp;guidelines](/community-guidelines).

      Still __getting started__? There are some great  [tutorials](#Tutorials)
      out there to get you on your feet. Want to __learn more__? There's some
      great [Sass blogs](#Blogs) (including
      [a few particular articles](#Articles) we recommend reading), and even a
      few [books about Sass](#Books) to help you learn some new tips and
      tricks.

      The Sass community is amazing. There are a number of
      [frameworks](#Frameworks) that make using Sass simple. Want to try Sass in
      Node, Python, or another framework? Check out the
      [libSass&nbsp;resources](/libsass).

      Thinking of __contributing__  to Sass itself? We rely on everyone to
      keep Sass as stable as it is. Feel free to
      [submit a patch via pull request](#Contribute) to the Sass project.

      Want to create your own Sass implementation? Check out our
      [implementation guidelines](/implementation).

    Sass is an [open source project][github] and we encourage you to contribute.
    You can contribute with [bug reports and feature requests][issues], and if
    you contribute code, we'll love you forever. If you just want to help out
    but you're not sure what to do, check out the "Help Wanted" label for [the
    Sass language][lang help] or for [Dart Sass][dart help]. These issues
    are a mix of feature requests, bugs, and tasks that aren't coding-intensive
    that the developers think are a good place for someone new to the codebase
    to jump in.

    [Dart Sass][] is the reference implementation of Sass, and the easiest
    implementation to start hacking on. If you don't know Dart, don't worry!
    It's very easy to pick up. Check out the [contributing info][] for more
    information on helping out. Or, if you're interested in helping add new
    features to the Sass language, look at [the language contribution
    process][].

  __Everyone is welcome in the Sass community, except those who are
  unwelcoming__. Please read and follow our
  [community&nbsp;guidelines](/community-guidelines).

  Thinking of __contributing__  to Sass itself? We rely on everyone to
  keep Sass as stable as it is. Feel free to
  [submit a patch via pull request](#Contribute) to the Sass project.

  Want to create your own Sass implementation? Check out our
  [implementation guidelines](/implementation).

%h2#Contribute Contribute

:markdown

  Sass is an [open source project][github] and we encourage you to contribute.
  You can contribute with [bug reports and feature requests][issues], and if
  you contribute code, we'll love you forever. If you just want to help out
  but you're not sure what to do, check out the "Help Wanted" label for [the
  Sass language][lang help] or for [Dart Sass][dart help]. These issues
  are a mix of feature requests, bugs, and tasks that aren't coding-intensive
  that the developers think are a good place for someone new to the codebase
  to jump in.

  [Dart Sass][] is the reference implementation of Sass, and the easiest
  implementation to start hacking on. If you don't know Dart, don't worry!
  It's very easy to pick up. Check out the [contributing info][] for more
  information on helping out. Or, if you're interested in helping add new
  features to the Sass language, look at [the language contribution
  process][].

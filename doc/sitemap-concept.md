## Get Sass 

(information on getting set up with a designer focus and a developer focus — emphasis on how fast an easy it is. GUI clients, Repo link, etc.)

## Documentation

* Reference — make this beautiful, legible, illustrative, helpful
* Cheat Sheet (a pretty printable PDF to tape up by your desk) — or maybe a pocket guide?
* Suggested best practices from experts
* Resources (videos, articles, presentations, books, etc).
* Next steps (link to Compass, Susy, etc)

## Tutorials

* Try Sass — awesome guide that takes you step by step through the basics of Sass. I love this guide: http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git — something like that would be great.
* Intermediate Sass — a guide to move to the next level.
* Advanced Sass — learn expert stuff.

## Examples

* Awesome projects that use Sass — could be a gallery or maybe even a case study. Either way, show both big & small sites/apps and try to emphasis how Sass made it all possible/better.

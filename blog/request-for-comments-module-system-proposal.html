The import system that we&rsquo;ve had since the very early releases of&nbsp;Sass is, to put it simply, not great. It does little more than textually include&nbsp;one Sass file in another, which makes it hard to keep track of where&nbsp;mixins, functions, and variables were defined and hard to be sure that any new&nbsp;additions won&rsquo;t happen to conflict with something elsewhere in the project. To&nbsp;make matters worse, it overlaps with <span class=caps>CSS</span>&rsquo;s built-in <code>@import</code> rule, which forces&nbsp;us to have <a href="../documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#import">a bunch of&nbsp;heuristics</a> to decide which is&nbsp;which.</p> <p>Because of these problems and others, we&rsquo;ve wanted to do a full overhaul of&nbsp;the way Sass files relate to one another for a long time. Over the last few&nbsp;years, I&rsquo;ve been working with the Sass core team and Sass framework maintainers&nbsp;to create a proposal for a module system that&rsquo;s fit to replace <code>@import</code>.&nbsp;That proposal is now in a place that the core team is pretty happy with, at least&nbsp;as a starting point, so we want to open it up for community&nbsp;feedback.</p> <p>If you want to read the full proposal, <a href="https://github.com/sass/language/blob/main/accepted/module-system.md">it&rsquo;s available&nbsp;on GitHub</a>. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/sass/language/issues/new">file issues</a> for&nbsp;any feedback you have. The main body of the proposal is written as a spec, so&nbsp;it&rsquo;s very detailed, but the Goals, Summary, and <span class=caps>FAQ</span> sections (reproduced&nbsp;below) should be accessible to anyone familiar with&nbsp;Sass.</p> <h2 id=goals> <a class=anchor href="#goals"><span class=visuallyhidden>Goals permalink</span></a>Goals</h2> <h3 id=high-level> <a class=anchor href="#high-level"><span class=visuallyhidden>High-Level permalink</span></a>High-Level</h3> <p>These are the philosophical design goals for the module system as a whole.&nbsp;While they don&rsquo;t uniquely specify a system, they do represent the&nbsp;underlying motivations behind many of the lower-level design&nbsp;decisions.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Locality</strong>. The module system should make it possible to understand a&nbsp;Sass file by looking only at that file. An important aspect of this is that&nbsp;names in the file should be resolved based on the contents of the file rather&nbsp;than the global state of the compilation. This also applies to authoring: an&nbsp;author should be able to be confident that a name is safe to use as long as&nbsp;it doesn&rsquo;t conflict with any name visible in the&nbsp;file.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Encapsulation</strong>. The module system should allow authors,&nbsp;particularly library authors, to choose what <span class=caps>API</span> they expose. They should be able to&nbsp;define entities for internal use without making those entities available for&nbsp;external users to access or modify. The organization of a library&rsquo;s implementation&nbsp;into files should be flexible enough to change without changing the&nbsp;user-visible <span class=caps>API.</span></p></li> <li><p><strong>Configuration</strong>. Sass is unusual among languages in that its design leads&nbsp;to the use of files whose entire purpose is to produce side&nbsp;effects—specifically, to emit <span class=caps>CSS.</span> There&rsquo;s also a broader class of libraries that may not emit&nbsp;<span class=caps>CSS</span> directly, but do define configuration variables that are used in&nbsp;computations, including computation of other top-level variables&rsquo; values. The module&nbsp;system should allow the user to flexibly use and configure modules with&nbsp;side-effects.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id=low-level> <a class=anchor href="#low-level"><span class=visuallyhidden>Low-Level permalink</span></a>Low-Level</h3> <p>These are goals that are based less on philosophy than on practicality. For&nbsp;the most part, they&rsquo;re derived from user feedback that we&rsquo;ve collected&nbsp;about <code>@import</code> over the&nbsp;years.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Import once</strong>. Because <code>@import</code> is a literal textual inclusion,&nbsp;multiple <code>@import</code>s of the same Sass file within the scope of a compilation&nbsp;will compile and run that file multiple times. At best this hurts compilation&nbsp;time for little benefit, and it can also contribute to bloated <span class=caps>CSS</span> output when&nbsp;the styles themselves are duplicated. The new module system should only compile&nbsp;a file&nbsp;once.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Backwards compatibility</strong>. We want to make it as easy as possible for&nbsp;people to migrate to the new module system, and that means making it work&nbsp;in conjunction with existing stylesheets that use <code>@import</code>. Existing&nbsp;stylesheets that only use <code>@import</code> should have identical importing behavior to&nbsp;earlier versions of Sass, and stylesheets should be able to change parts to&nbsp;<code>@use</code> without changing the whole thing at&nbsp;once.</p></li> </ul> <h3 id=non-goals> <a class=anchor href="#non-goals"><span class=visuallyhidden>Non-Goals permalink</span></a>Non-Goals</h3> <p>These are potential goals that we have explicitly decided to avoid pursuing&nbsp;as part of this proposal for various reasons. Some of them may be on the table&nbsp;for future work, but we don&rsquo;t consider them to be blocking the module&nbsp;system.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Dynamic imports</strong>. Allowing the path to a module to be defined&nbsp;dynamically, whether by including variables or including it in a conditional block,&nbsp;moves away from being declarative. In addition to making stylesheets harder to&nbsp;read, this makes any sort of static analysis more difficult (and actually&nbsp;impossible in the general case). It also limits the possibility of future&nbsp;implementation optimizations.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Importing multiple files at once</strong>. In addition to the long-standing&nbsp;reason that this hasn&rsquo;t been supported—that it opens authors up to sneaky&nbsp;and difficult-to-debug ordering bugs—this violates the principle of locality&nbsp;by obfuscating which files are imported and thus where names come&nbsp;from.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Extend-only imports</strong>. The idea of importing a file so that the <span class=caps>CSS</span>&nbsp;it generates isn&rsquo;t emitted unless it&rsquo;s <code>@extend</code>ed is cool, but it&rsquo;s also a&nbsp;lot of extra work. This is the most likely feature to end up in a future&nbsp;release, but it&rsquo;s not central enough to include in the initial module&nbsp;system.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Context-independent modules</strong>. It&rsquo;s tempting to try to make the loaded&nbsp;form of a module, including the <span class=caps>CSS</span> it generates and the resolved values of all&nbsp;its variables, totally independent of the entrypoint that cause it to be&nbsp;loaded. This would make it possible to share loaded modules across&nbsp;multiple compilations and potentially even serialize them to the filesystem&nbsp;for incremental&nbsp;compilation.</p></li> </ul> <p>However, it&rsquo;s not feasible in practice. Modules that generate <span class=caps>CSS</span>&nbsp;almost always do so based on some configuration, which may be changed by&nbsp;different entrypoints rendering caching useless. What&rsquo;s more, multiple modules&nbsp;may depend on the same shared module, and one may modify its configuration&nbsp;before the other uses it. Forbidding this case in general would effectively amount&nbsp;to forbidding modules from generating <span class=caps>CSS</span> based on&nbsp;variables.</p> <p>Fortunately, implementations have a lot of leeway to cache information&nbsp;that the can statically determine to be context-independent, including source&nbsp;trees and potentially even constant-folded variable values and <span class=caps>CSS</span> trees.&nbsp;Full context independence isn&rsquo;t likely to provide much value in addition to&nbsp;that.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Increased strictness</strong>. Large teams with many people often want&nbsp;stricter rules around how Sass stylesheets are written, to enforce best practices&nbsp;and quickly catch mistakes. It&rsquo;s tempting to use a new module system as a lever&nbsp;to push strictness further; for example, we could make it harder to have&nbsp;partials directly generate <span class=caps>CSS</span>, or we could decline to move functions we&rsquo;d&nbsp;prefer people avoid to the new built-in&nbsp;modules.</li> </ul> <p>As tempting as it is, though, we want to make all existing use-cases as&nbsp;easy as possible in the new system, <em>even if we think they should be avoided</em>.&nbsp;This module system is already a major departure from the existing behavior,&nbsp;and will require a substantial amount of work from Sass users to support. We&nbsp;want to make this transition as easy as possible, and part of that is&nbsp;avoiding adding any unnecessary hoops users have to jump through to get their&nbsp;existing stylesheets working in the new module&nbsp;system.</p> <p>Once <code>@use</code> is thoroughly adopted in the ecosystem, we can start&nbsp;thinking about increased strictness in the form of lints or&nbsp;TypeScript-style <code>--strict-*</code>&nbsp;flags.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Code splitting</strong>. The ability to split monolithic <span class=caps>CSS</span> into separate&nbsp;chunks that can be served lazily is important for maintaining quick load times&nbsp;for very large applications. However, it&rsquo;s orthogonal to the problems that&nbsp;this module system is trying to solve. This system is primarily concerned&nbsp;with scoping Sass APIs (mixins, functions, and placeholders) rather than&nbsp;declaring dependencies between chunks of generated&nbsp;<span class=caps>CSS.</span></li> </ul> <p>We believe that this module system can work in concert with&nbsp;external code-splitting systems. For example, the module system can be used to&nbsp;load libraries that are used to style individual components, each of which&nbsp;is compiled to its own <span class=caps>CSS</span> file. These <span class=caps>CSS</span> files could then declare&nbsp;dependencies on one another using special comments or custom at-rules and be&nbsp;stitched together by a code-splitting&nbsp;post-processor.</p> <h2 id=summary> <a class=anchor href="#summary"><span class=visuallyhidden>Summary permalink</span></a>Summary</h2> <p>This proposal adds two at-rules, <code>@use</code> and <code>@forward</code>, which may only appear&nbsp;at the top level of stylesheets before any rules (other than <code>@charset</code>).&nbsp;Together, they&rsquo;re intended to completely replace <code>@import</code>, which will eventually&nbsp;be deprecated and even more eventually removed from the&nbsp;language.</p> <h3 id=use> <a class=anchor href="#use"><span class=visuallyhidden>@use permalink</span></a><code>@use</code> </h3> <p><code>@use</code> makes <span class=caps>CSS</span>, variables, mixins, and functions from another&nbsp;stylesheet accessible in the current stylesheet.

</code></pre> <h3 id=import-compatibility> <a class=anchor href="#import-compatibility"><span class=visuallyhidden>@import Compatibility permalink</span></a><code>@import</code>&nbsp;Compatibility</h3> <p>The Sass ecosystem won&rsquo;t switch to <code>@use</code> overnight, so in the meantime it&nbsp;needs to interoperate well with <code>@import</code>. This is supported in both&nbsp;directions:</p> <ul> <li><p>When a file that contains <code>@import</code>s is <code>@use</code>d, everything in its&nbsp;global namespace is treated as a single module.

This allows a library&nbsp;to control what specific names it exports, even for users who <code>@import</code> it&nbsp;rather than <code>@use</code>&nbsp;it.</p></li> </ul> <p>In order to allow libraries to maintain their existing <code>@import</code>-oriented&nbsp;<span class=caps>API</span>, with explicit namespacing where necessary, this proposal also adds support&nbsp;for files that are only visible to <code>@import</code>, not to <code>@use</code>.

These will hold all&nbsp;the existing built-in Sass functions. Because these modules will (typically)&nbsp;be imported with a namespace, it will be much easier to use Sass functions&nbsp;without running into conflicts with plain <span class=caps>CSS</span>&nbsp;functions.</p> <p>This in turn will make it much safer for Sass to add new functions.

This mixin dynamically loads the module with the given <span class=caps>URL</span> and includes its&nbsp;<span class=caps>CSS</span> (although its functions, variables, and mixins are not made available). This&nbsp;is a replacement for nested imports, and it helps address some use-cases of&nbsp;dynamic imports without many of the problems that would arise if new members could&nbsp;be loaded&nbsp;dynamically.</p> <h2 id=frequently-asked-questions> <a class=anchor href="#frequently-asked-questions"><span class=visuallyhidden>Frequently Asked Questions permalink</span></a>Frequently Asked&nbsp;Questions</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Why this privacy model?</strong> We considered a number of models for&nbsp;declaring members to be private, including a <span class=caps>JS</span>-like model where only members that&nbsp;were explicitly exported from a module were visible and a C#-like model with&nbsp;an explicit <code>@private</code> keyword. These models involve a lot more&nbsp;boilerplate, though, and they work particularly poorly for placeholder selectors&nbsp;where privacy may be mixed within a single style rule. Name-based privacy&nbsp;also provides a degree of compatibility with conventions libraries are&nbsp;already using.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Can I make a member library-private?</strong> There&rsquo;s no language-level notion of&nbsp;a <span class=dquo>&ldquo;</span>library&rdquo;, so library-privacy isn&rsquo;t built in either. However, members used&nbsp;by one module aren&rsquo;t automatically visible to downstream modules. If a&nbsp;module isn&rsquo;t <a href="#forward"><code>@forward</code>ed</a> through a library&rsquo;s main stylesheet, it&nbsp;won&rsquo;t be visible to downstream consumers and thus is effectively&nbsp;library-private. <br><br> As a convention, we recommend that libraries write&nbsp;library-private stylesheets that aren&rsquo;t intended to be used directly by their users in&nbsp;a directory named&nbsp;<code>src</code>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>How do I make my library configurable?</strong> If you have a large library made&nbsp;up of many source files that all share some core <code>!default</code>-based&nbsp;configuration, we recommend that you define that configuration in a file that gets&nbsp;forwarded from your library&rsquo;s entrypoint and used by your library&rsquo;s files.

We&rsquo;re pretty happy with the overall shape of&nbsp;the module system, but it&rsquo;s not at all set in stone, and anything can change&nbsp;with enough feedback provided by users like you. If you have opinions, please <a href="https://github.com/sass/language/issues/new">file an issue on GitHub</a> or just <a href="https://twitter.com/SassCSS">tweet at @Sass<span class=caps>CSS</span></a>.
